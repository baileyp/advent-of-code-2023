## Part 1

Ok, so that was weird. This might be the least amount of code (ignoring tests) I've written for an AoC puzzle _ever_.
Basically a single map reduce operation ⭐

Should I be freaked out about part 2?

## Part 2

Not hard at all. I think this part is maybe designed to trip people who who don't know how certain datatypes behave in
their language of choice, such as I validated with a CP prompt:

> Do ruby hashes remember key insertion order?

When it came to the actual puzzle solve, this was pretty easy but I did ask CP one more question to get me started:

> Can ruby arrays have a default value similar to passing a block of code to Hash.new?

Armed with this knowledge, I was off!

In all I'd say I think this has been the simplest puzzle yet this year ⭐
