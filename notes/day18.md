# Day 18

[Solution](../lib/day18.rb) | [Spec](../spec/day18_spec.rb) | [Input](../input/day18.txt)

## Part 1

Pretty simple puzzle. CP of course did it's thing with lots of tab-completes but otherwise this was a straight-forward
DFS or BFS problem, the latter of which I chose here.

Of course, the solution doesn't even require the `color` values from the input so those will inevitably feature in
part 2 some way.

## Part 2

Incomplete
