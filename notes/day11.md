## Part 1

This is the type of puzzle where my years of AoC puzzle solving comes in handy. Using the right data types for the right
task, etc. In fact, AoC puzzles are the only reason I know what a Manhattan Distance is. On that note, CP did lots of
tab-complete work here including the entirety of the `manhattan_distance` function.

Anyway, for those combination of factors I did not find this troubling ⭐
