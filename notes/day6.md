# Day 6

## Part 1

Not much to say here. Puzzle was easy and code was easy. I did TDD for `parse_input` and prompted CP for the code, just
because it's kind of fun, but the solutioning was all me ⭐

## Part 2

I think the intent here was to fine a non-linear time solution but the one I already had runs in under four seconds and
my goals this year don't include finding optimizing for time & space complexity - I've done plenty of that in prior
years.

So, once again, I got this done by writing the spec for `parse_input2`, prompting CP for a satisfying function and then
writing `part2` by hand. Easy-peasy ⭐
