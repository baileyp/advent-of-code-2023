# Day 20

## Part 1

I didn't find this too hard. If there's a trick here I think it's the use of a queue to process the pulses in the
correct order per the puzzle input. No prompting, I just wrote the code myself.

I will say that there a lot of things I'm enjoying about ruby but long chains of bracket-notion dereferencing is just a
bit more cumbersome than dot-notation, but I guess I see why - reserved-word collisions would be a nightmare.

Anyways, as I've been in the habit of saying recently, not the prettiest code but it got me a ‚≠ê

## Part 2

Hrmph. This is the 3rd day in a row where part 2 is ruthless against literal modelings of the problem space. I'm going
to guess that the solution here involves some sort of tree-walk permutation calculation thing. Not in the mood for that
just now, going to move on.
