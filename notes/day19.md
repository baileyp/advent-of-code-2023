# Day 19

[Solution](../lib/day19.rb) | [Spec](../spec/day19_spec.rb) | [Input](../input/day19.txt)

## Part 1

I enjoy the functional aspect of solutions like this one. Ruby has just enough first-class treatment of functions with
lambdas that makes this possible. I really didn't seek any help from CP here other than to write `parse_workflow` from
the spec - after I did some thinking and decided what I wanted each workflow to look like in a parsed format. I'm
particularly pleased with being able to `inject` the operation that achieves some `eval`-like qualities without actually
being `eval` since... you know... _eval is **evil**_. ‚≠ê
