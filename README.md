# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions for the [2023 Advent of Code puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

## Requirements

## Goals

I don't know [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), but my team is using it heavily in our current product. But
I don't know Ruby.

Yet, this year, not only am I going write all of my puzzles solutions in Ruby, but I will do so with no official
or un-official language references, no Stack Overflow, and no googling.

The only aid I will use is Github Copilot.

What I will _not_ be doing is consulting AI for algorithmic help - the puzzle solving will still come from my
brain and I will use AI solely for getting things done with Ruby.

In additon to writing solutions to the puzzles, I will also see how far I can push Copilot in terms of writing
unit tests, documentation, and whatever else comes to mind as I begin. I will also endeavor to keep a log/blog
of my experiences but that will likely suffer the natural limitations of time that always occur in December.

Happy coding!
